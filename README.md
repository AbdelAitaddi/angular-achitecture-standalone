# Angular Architecture: âš¡ standalone âš¡

## Example project: Rental search app (ApartmentSearch).

<img src="./screenshots/screenshot.png" alt="App Screenshots">

> **Rental search app (ApartmentSearch)**
>
> A project that provides a practical introduction to Angular Enterprise Architecture, focusing on:
> - Component-First Architecture with Standalone Components.
> - Smart and Dumb Components (Container & Presentational Components for better separation of concerns).
> - Custom Reactive State Management, built on RxJS.
>
> The user can search for apartments by the desired city and district, view detailed information about a selected apartment, and mark it as a favorite. Additionally, the app offers features such as language switching and more.
>
>  This project represents a migration from Angular-achitecture-modular to a Component-First architecture(standalone).

> Built using Angular CLI 16.2.0 & json-server.


## Purpose
this project consists of writing a Angular with the purpose to learn how to design an Angular application with a focus on maintaining sustainable development speed and the ease of adding new features in the long run.
This application present high-level recommendations for a well-designed Angular application architecture based on best practices and battle-tested patterns.

- Project structure and settings.
- Component-First architecture (standalone)
- Proper abstractions between application layers.
- Smart and Dumb components pattern.
- Unidirectional data flow.
- Reactive state management (using own RxJS store).

## Implementation

This application provides a comprehensive learning experience by incorporating advanced Angular techniques and best practices.

ðŸ”¹ **State Management with own RxJS Store**: Understand how to use RxJS to build own Store for modern state management.

ðŸ”¹ **Creating Smart and Dumb components**: build highly efficient, components using Angular  Smart and Dumb components pattern.

ðŸ”¹ **Preloading Configuration Files**: Learn how to dynamically load a configuration file before the app initializes, enabling flexible settings management without modifying the code.

ðŸ”¹ **Custom SVG Icon Integration**: Implement a system for registering and using custom SVG icons within the application to enhance UI design and maintain scalability.

ðŸ”¹ **Internationalization (i18n) with @ngx-translate/core**: Explore how to implement multilingual support efficiently using a third-party library, making the app accessible to users in different languages.

ðŸ”¹ **Infinite Scrolling for Enhanced User Experience**: Learn to integrate infinite scrolling in a listing view, allowing users to load more data seamlessly as they scroll, improving performance and usability.

ðŸ”¹ **Global Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error-handling mechanism to catch and manage errors globally, ensuring a robust and user-friendly web application.

ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Page Titles with Angular Router**: Set page titles dynamically using Angular Router.


## UI Features

- **Apartment Search Page**: browse available apartments.
- **Detailed Apartment Overview**: view comprehensive details about each apartment.
- **Multilingual Support**: the app supports internationalization in three languages, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.
- **Advanced Filtering:**: users can refine their search by city and borough, making it easier to find the perfect apartment. Additionally, more listings can be loaded dynamically via scrolling.
- **Favorites Management:** a dedicated favorites page allows users to quickly view and manage their saved apartments.
- **Favorites & Storage Sync**: save preferred apartments to a favorites list, which automatically syncs with local storage for easy access across sessions.
